## Introduction

### Elements of Information Security
Information security is a state of well-being of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of <b>theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services</b> is low or tolerable

  <tr>
    <td>Confidentiality</td>
    <td>Assurance that the information is accessible only to those <b>authorized to have access</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Integrity</td>
    <td>The <b>trustworthiness of data or resources</b> in terms of preventing improper or unauthorized changes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Availablity</td>
    <td>Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when <b>required by the authorized users</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Authenticity</td>
    <td>Refers to the characteristic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the <b>quality of being genuine</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Non-Repudiation</td>
    <td>A <b>guarantee</b> that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recinient cannot deny having received the message</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Motives, Goals, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks

```
Attacks = Motive(Goal) + Method + Vulnerability
```

* A motive originates out of the notion that the <b>target system stores or precesses</b> something valuable, and thes leads to the threat of an attack on the system
* Attackers try various tools and attack techniques to <b>exploit vulnerabilities</b> in a computer system or ts security policy and controls in order to fulfil their motives

### Motives behind information security attacks
* Desrupting business continuity
* Stealing information and manipulationg data
* Creating fear and chaos by disrupting critical infrastructures
* Causingfinancial loss to the target
* Propagating religious or political beliefs
* Achieving a state's military objectives
* Damaging the reputation of the target
* Takingrevenge
* Demanding ransom

### Information Warfare
The term information warfare or InfoWar refers to he <b>use of information and communication technologies(ICT)</b> to gain competitive advantages over an opponent

<b>Defensive Information Warfare</b>
* Refers to all strategies and actions designed to <b>defend against attacks on ICT assets

<b>Offensive Information Warfare</b>
* Refer to information warfare that involves <b>attacks against the ICT assets</b> of an opponent

<b>Defensive Warfare</b>
* Prevention
* Deterrence
* Alerts
* Detection
* Emergency Preparedness
* Respnse

<b>Offensive Warfare</b>
* Web Application Attacks
* Web Server Attacks
* Malware Attacks
* MITM Attacks
* System Hacking

### CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)
```
Footprinting --> Scanning --> Enumeraton --> Valnerability Analysis --> System Hacking
```
<b>System Hacking</b>
* Gaining Access
    * Cracking Passwords
    * Valnerability Exploitation
* Escalating Privileges
* Maintaining Access
    * Executing Applications
    * Hiding Files
* Clearing Logs
    * Covering Tracks

### Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
* The cyber kill chain methodology is a component of intelligence-driven defense for the identification and <b>prevention of malicious intrusion activities</b>
* It provides greater insight into attack phases, which helps security professionals to understand the <b>adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures beforehand</b>
